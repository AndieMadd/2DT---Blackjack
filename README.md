Command Line Based Blackjack Game

The only important files within this are server.py and client.py

MAKING SURE YOU CONNECT PROPERLY:
1) Run server.py
2) See what IP the server is running one
3) Change the host in client.py to this IP address
4) Run client.py in a new command window for each player. (I suggest 2 while testing)
5) Follow instructions on client windows.
